# Reverse

## Introduction
In Kotlin, the `reverse` function is a useful method that allows you to reverse the elements of an array or a collection. This function creates a new array or list with the elements in the opposite order, making it easy to manipulate data that needs to be processed in a reversed sequence. Reversing an array can be particularly helpful in algorithms that require backtracking or in scenarios where the order of elements is significant.

## Syntax
To reverse an array or list in Kotlin, you can use the `reversed()` function for collections, or the `reverse()` function for mutable lists. The syntax is as follows:

### For Immutable Lists:
```kotlin
val reversedList = originalList.reversed()
